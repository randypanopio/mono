1) What were the four commands you used to assemble, compile, link, and run in the "Compiling and Assembling" section?



Singular command: 
gcc -Wall -Wpedantic -std=c17 -march=haswell array_sum_speed.c array_sum.S -o my_program

2) What was the first command you used to compile array_sum.c? How must faster/slower was your C implementation compared to the provided assembly?


3) How did the speed of the C and assembly implementations of array_sum compare after you added -O3 to the compilation command? How did C speed compare with and without -O3?
